# AutomatingStuffWithPython

Here in this repository we will try to automate few stuffs using python scripts. These will help us to learn about some cool python librarries and get our hands dirty more in python.
The output of these code really amazed me and thus excites me to continue doing some cool stuffs.

### [FacebookLogin.py](https://github.com/shristi945/AutomatingStuffWithPython/blob/master/FacebookLogin.py)

#### Overview
Boring web-based administration tasks can be automated as well. We use selenium here to open the site of our requirement (in this case Facebook) and there we inspect element across email box, password box and login button to find id of them. Using the function provided by selenium module, we can find the required element (username box, password box, login button) and we will send the data into the box.

#### Installation Required
Selenium : to automate browser
pip install -U selenium

Time : to pause running of script for some seconds as browsers try to detect automation stuff if we input too fast
Most of the time it is already installed with python.
